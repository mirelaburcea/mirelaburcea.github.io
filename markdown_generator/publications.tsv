110	James F. Lutsko	How crystals form: A theory of nucleation pathways	Science Advances	5	eaav7399	2019	http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/4/eaav7399	Recent advances in classical density functional theory are combined with stochastic process theory and rare event techniques to formulate a theoretical description of nucleation, including crystallization, that can predict nonclassical nucleation pathways based on no input other than the interaction potential of the particles making up the system. The theory is formulated directly in terms of the density field, thus forgoing the need to define collective variables. It is illustrated by application to diffusion-limited nucleation of macromolecules in solution for both liquid-liquid separation and crystallization. Both involve nonclassical pathways with crystallization, in particular, proceeding by a two-step mechanism consisting of the formation of a dense-solution droplet followed by ordering originating at the core of the droplet. Furthermore, during the ordering, the free-energy surface shows shallow minima associated with the freezing of liquid into solid shells, which may shed light on the widely observed metastability of nanoscale clusters.

Van Driessche	Mineral Growth beyond the Limits of Impurity Poisoning	Crystal Growth and Design	18	171	2018	Lutsko_CGD_2017.pdf	More often than not, minerals formed in nature are grown at low supersaturation and from sources that are impure with respect to the crystals’ main building blocks. Quite paradoxically, these conditions are in conflict with the established crystal growth theories that focus on the interplay between the crystal interface and impurities that are present in the growth medium. These theories predict a kinetic dead zone for the cases where low purity is combined with weak driving forces. Hints toward reconciling this apparent disparity have been given by the observation that a specific class of steps, socalled macrosteps, can circumvent the debilitating kinetic effects of impurities in ways that up until now are poorly understood. In this contribution, we examine the mechanism of crystal growth by means of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation at conditions close to impurity-induced kinetic arrest. In agreement with previous reports, we show that as a result of impurity binding to the crystal surface, steps spontaneously group into bunches and later condense into macrosteps. A kinetic analysis demonstrates that these macrosteps are able to evade crystal growth cessation under conditions where single steps are firmly pinned. We identify the mechanism of interstep cooperativity which leads to cessation evasion by macrosteps and demonstrate that it applies to a range of supersaturation and impurity concentration values. On the basis of these findings, we present a model that explains how minerals can grow from mother liquor solutions that would otherwise seem to be nonconducive to crystal growth.

Lutsko	Lattice induced crystallization of nanodroplets: the role of finite-size effects and substrate properties in controlling polymorphism	Nanoscale	10	4921	2018	Lam_Lutsko_Nanoscale_2018.pdf	Targeting specific technological applications requires the control of nanoparticle properties, especially the crystalline polymorph. Freezing a nanodroplet deposited on a solid substrate leads to the formation of crystalline structures. We study the inherent mechanisms underlying this general phenomenon by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Our work shows that different crystal structures can be selected by finely tuning the solid substrate lattice parameter. Indeed, while for our system, face-centered cubic is usually the most preponderant structure, the growth of two distinct polymorphs, hexagonal centered packing and body-centered cubic, was also observed even when the solid substrate was face-centered cubic. Finally, we also demonstrated that the growth of hexagonal centered packing is conditioned by the appearance of large enough body-centered cubic clusters thus suggesting the presence of a cross-nucleation pathway. Our results provide insights into the impact of nanoscale effects and solid substrate properties towards the growth of polymorphic nanomaterials.

Duran-Olivencia, Peter Yatsyshin, Serafim Kalliadasis, and Jim Lutsko	General framework for nonclassical nucleation	New Journal of Physics	20	83019	2018	Lutsko_2018_3.pdf	A great deal of experimental evidence suggests that a wide spectrum of phase transitions occur in a multistage manner via the appearance and subsequen transformation of intermediate metastable states. Such multistage mechanisms cannot be explained within the realm of the classical nucleation framework. Hence, there is a strong need to develop new theoretical tools to explain the occurrence and nature of these ubiquitous intermediate phases. Here we outline a unified and self-consistent theoretical framework to describe both classical and nonclassical nucleation. Our framework provides a detailed explanation of the whole multistage nucleation pathway showing in particular that the pathway involves a single energy barrier and it passes through a dense phase, starting from a low-density initial phase, before reaching the final stable state. Moreover, we demonstrate that the kinetics of matter inside subcritical clusters favours the formation of nucleation clusters with an intermediate density, i.e. nucleation precursors. Remarkably, these nucleation precursors are not associated with a local minimum of the thermodynamic potential, as commonly assumed in previous phenomenological approaches. On the contrary, we find that they emerge due to the competition between thermodynamics and kinetics.
107	James F. Lutsko	Classical density functional theory, unconstrained crystallization, and polymorphic behavior	Phys. Rev. E	98	12604	2018	Lutsko_PRE_2018.pdf	While in principle, classical density functional theory (cDFT) should be a powerful tool for the study of crystallization, in practice this has not so far been the case. Progress has been hampered by technical problems which have plagued the study of the crystalline systems using the most sophisticated fundamental measure theory models. In this paper, the reasons for the difficulties are examined and it is proposed that the tensor functionals currently favored are in fact numerically unstable. By reverting to an older, more heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are eliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of power of cDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system. First, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall crystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites are clearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures. In contrast, droplets in a fully periodic calculational cell remain stable to lower temperatures and eventually show the same spontaneous localization of the density into “atoms” but in an amorphous structure having many of the structural characteristics of a glass. A small change of the protocol leads, at the same temperature, to the formation of crystals, this time with the fcc structure typical of bulk Lennard-Jones solids. The fcc crystals have lower free energy than the amorphous structures which in turn are more stable than the liquid droplets. It is demonstrated that as the temperature israised, the free energy differences between the structures decrease until the solid clusters become less stable thanthe liquid droplets and spontaneously melt. The presence of energy barriers separating the various structures is therefore clearly demonstrated.
106	James F. Lutsko	Systematically extending classical nucleation theory	New Journal of Physics	20	103015	2018	Lutsko_2018_5.pdf	The foundation for any discussion of first-order phse transitions is Classical Nucleation The- ory(CNT). CNT, developed in the first half of the twentieth century, is based on a number of heuristically plausible assumtptions and the majority of theoretical work on nucleation is devoted to refining or extending these ideas. Ideally, one would like to derive CNT from a more fundamen- tal description of nucleation so that its extension, development and refinement could be developed systematically. In this paper, such a development is described based on a previously established (Lutsko, JCP 136:034509, 2012 ) connection between Classical Nucleation Theory and fluctuating hydrodynamics. Here, this connection is described without the need for artificial assumtions such as spherical symmetry. The results are illustrated by application to CNT with moving clusters (a long-standing problem in the literature) and the constructrion of CNT for ellipsoidal clusters.

Lutsko	Solvent-mediated interactions between nanostructures: From water to Lennard-Jones liquid	J. of Chemical Physics	149	134703	2018	Lutsko_2018_6.pdf	Solvent-mediated interactions emerge from complex mechanisms that depend on the solute structure, its wetting properties, and the nature of the liquid. While numerous studies have focused on the first two influences, here, we compare the results from water and Lennard-Jones liquid in order to reveal to what extent solvent-mediated interactions are universal with respect to the nature of the liquid. Besides the influence of the liquid, the results were obtained with classical density functional theory and brute-force molecular dynamics simulations which allow us to contrast these two numerical techniques.
104	Jean Pierre Boon and James F. Lutsko	Temporal diffusion: From microscopic dynamics to generalised Fokker-Planck and fractional equations	J. Statistical Physics	166	1441	2017	Boon_Lutsko_2017.pdf	The temporal Fokker–Planck equation (Boon et al. in J Stat Phys 3/4: 527, 2003) or propagation–dispersion equation was derived to describe diffusive processes with temporal dispersion rather than spatial dispersion as in classical diffusion. We present two generalizations of the temporal Fokker–Planck equation for the first passage distribution function f j(r, t) of a particle moving on a substrate with time delays τ j . Both generalizations follow from the first visit recurrence relation. In the first case, the time delays depend on the local concentration, that is the time delay probability Pj is a functional of the particle distribution function and we show that when the functional dependence is of the power law type, Pj ∝ f ν−1 j , the generalized Fokker–Planck equation exhibits a structure similar to that of the nonlinear spatial diffusion equation where the roles of space and time are reversed. In the second case, we consider the situation where the time delays are distributed according to a power law, Pj ∝ τ −1−α j (with 0 <α< 2), in which case we obtain a fractional propagationdispersion equation which is the temporal analog of the fractional spatial diffusion equation (with space and time interchanged). The analysis shows how certain microscopic mechanisms can lead to non-Gaussian distributions and non-classical scaling exponents.

Lutsko	Solute particle near a nanopore: influence of size and surface properties on the solvent-mediated forces	Nanoscale	9	17099	2017	Lam_Lutsko_Nanoscale_2017.pdf	Nanoscopic pores are used in various systems to attract nanoparticles. In general the behaviour is a result of two types of interactions: the material specific affinity and the solvent-mediated influence also called the depletion force. The latter is more universal but also much more complex to understand since it requires modeling both the nanoparticle and the solvent. Here, we employed classical density functional theory to determine the forces acting on a nanoparticle near a nanoscopic pore as a function of its hydrophobicity and its size. A simple capillary model is constructed to predict those depletion forces for various surface properties. For a nanoscopic pore, complexity arises from both the specific geometry and the fact that hydrophobic pores are not necessarily filled with liquid. Taking all of these effects into account and including electrostatic effects, we establish a phase diagram describing the entrance and the rejection of the nanoparticle from the pore.

Lett.	116	15501	2016	Lutsko_PRL_2016.pdf	Crystals grow by laying down new layers of material which can either correspond in size to the height of one unit cell (elementary steps) or multiple unit cells (macrosteps). Surprisingly, experiments have shown that macrosteps can grow under conditions of low supersaturation and high impurity density such that elementary step growth is completely arrested. We use atomistic simulations to show that this is due to two effects: the fact that the additional layers bias fluctuations in the position of the bottom layer towards growth and by a transition, as step height increases, from a 2D to a 3D nucleation mechanism.
101	James F. Lutsko 	Mechanism for the stabilization of protein clusters above the solubility curve: The role of non-ideal chemical reactions	J. Phys. Cond. Matt.	28	244020	2016	Lutsko_JPCM_2015_1.pdf	Dense protein clusters are known to play an important role in nucleation of protein crystals from dilute solutions. While these have generally been thought to be formed from a metastable phase, the observation of similar, if not identical, clusters above the critical point for the dilute-solution/strong-solution phase transition has thrown this into doubt. Furthermore, the observed clusters are stable for relatively long times. Because protein aggregation plays a central role in some pathologies, understanding the nature of such clusters is an important problem. One mechanism for the stabilization of such structures was proposed by Pan, Vekilov and Lubchenko and was investigated using a dynamical density functional theory model which confirmed the viability of the model. Here, we revisit that model and incorporate additional physics in the form of state-dependent reaction rates. We show by a combination of numerical results and general arguments that the state-dependent rates disrupt the stability mechanism. Finally, we argue that the state-dependent reactions correct unphysical aspects of the model with ideal (state-independent) reactions and that this necessarily leads to the failure of the proposed mechanism.
100	James F. Lutsko and Grégoire Nicolis	Mechanism for the stabilization of protein clusters above the solubility curve	Soft Matter	12	93	2016	Lutsko_SoftMatter_2016.pdf	Pan, Vekilov and Lubchenko [J. Phys. Chem. B, 2010, 114, 7620] have proposed that dense stable protein clusters appearing in weak protein solutions above the solubility curve are composed of protein oligomers. The hypothesis is that a weak solution of oligomer species is unstable with respect to condensation causing the formation of dense, oligomer-rich droplets which are stabilized against growth by the monomer–oligomer reaction. Here, we show that such a combination of processes can be understood using a simple capillary model yielding analytic expressions for the cluster properties which can be model and show that it is consistent with the predictions of the capillary model. The viability of the used to interpret experimental data. We also construct a microscopic Dynamic Density Functional Theory mechanism is thus confirmed and it is shown how the radius of the stable clusters is related to physically www.rsc.org/softmatter interesting quantities such as the monomer–oligomer rate constants.
99	James F. Lutsko and Miguel A. Durán-Olivencia	A Two-parameter Extension of Classical Nucleation Theory	J. Phys. Cond. Matt.	27	235101	2015	Lutsko_JPCM_2015_1.pdf	A two-variable stochastic model for diffusion-limited nucleation is developed using a formalism derived from fluctuating hydrodynamics. The model is a direct generalization of the standard Classical Nucleation Theory. The nucleation rate and pathway are calculated in the weak-noise approximation and are shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations for the weak-solution/strong-solution transition in globular proteins. We find that Classical Nucleation Theory underestimates the time needed for the formation of a critical cluster by two orders of magnitude and that this discrepancy is due to the more complex dynamics of the two variable model and not, as often is assumed, a result of errors in the estimation of the free energy barrier.

E	91	22402	2015	Lutsko_PRE_2015.pdf	Classical nucleation theory has been recently reformulated based on fluctuating hydrodynamics [J.F. Lutsko and M.A. Durán-Olivencia, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 244908(2013)]. The present work extends this effort to the case of nucleation in confined systems such as small pores and vesicles. The finite available mass imposes a maximal supercritical cluster size and prohibits nucleation altogether if the system is too small. We quantity the effect of system size on the nuceation rate. We also discuss the effect of relaxing the capillary-model assumption of zero interfacial width resulting in significant changes in the nucleation barrier and nucleation rate.

Lett.	114	245501	2015	Lutsko_PRL_2015_1.pdf	Nanoscale self-assembly is naturally subject to impediments at the nanoscale. The recently developed ability to follow processes at the molecular level forces us to resolve older, coarse-grained concepts in terms of their molecular mechanisms. In this Letter, we highlight one such example. We present evidence based on experimental and simulation data that one of the cornerstones of crystal growth theory, the CabreraVermilyea model of step advancement in the presence of impurities, is based on incomplete physics. We demonstrate that the piercing of an impurity fence by elementary steps is not solely determined by the Gibbs-Thomson effect, as assumed by Cabrera-Vermilyea. Our data show that for conditions leading up to growth cessation, step retardation is dominated by the formation of critically sized fluctuations. The growth recovery of steps is counter to what is typically assumed, not instantaneous. Our observations on mesoscopic impurities for lysozyme expose a nucleation-dominated regime of growth that has not been hitherto considered, where the system alternates between zero and near-pure velocity. The time spent by the system in arrest is the nucleation induction time required for the step to amass a supercritical fluctuation that pierces the impurity fence.

E	92	32407	2015	Lutsko_PRE_2015_2.pdf	Classical nucleation theory (CNT) is the most widely used framework to describe the early stage of first-order phase transitions. Unfortunately the different points of view adopted to derive it yield different kinetic equations for the probability density function, e.g. Zeldovich-Frenkel or Becker-Döring-Tunitskii equations. Starting from a phenomenological stochastic differential equation a unified equation is obtained in this work. In other words, CNT expressions are recovered by selecting one or another stochastic calculus. Moreover, it is shown that the unified CNT thus obtained produces the same Fokker-Planck equation as that form a recent update of CNT [J.F. Lutsko and M.A. Durán-Olivencia, J. Chem. Phys., 2013, 138, 244908] when mass transport is governed by diffusion. Finally, we derive a general induction-time expression along with specific approximations of it to be used under different scenarios. In particular, when the mass-transport mechanism is governed by direct impingement, volume diffusion, surface diffusion or interface transfer.
95	Jean Pierre Boon and James F. Lutsko	Molecular theory of anomalous diffusion - Application to Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy	J. Stat. Phys.	160	622	2015	Lutsko_JSP_2015.pdf	The nonlinear theory of anomalous diffusion is based on particle interactions giving an explicit microscopic description of diffusive processes leading to sub-, normal, or super-diffusion as a result competitive effects between attractive and repulsive interactions. We present the explicit analytical solution to the nonlinear diffusion equation which we then use to compute the correlation function which is experimentally measured by correlation spectroscopy. The theoretical results are applicable in particular to the analysis of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of marked molecules in biological systems. More specifically we consider the case of fluorescently labeled lipids and we find that the nonlinear correlation spectrum reproduces very well the experimental data indicating sub-diffusive molecular motion of lipid molecules in the cell membrane.

A key factor determining the dynamics of crystallization is the effect of impurities on step growth. For over fifty years, all discussions of impurity-step interaction have been framed in the context of the Cabrera--Vermilyea (CV) model for step blocking, which has nevertheless proven difficult to validate experimentally. Here we report on extensive computer simulations which clearly falsify the CV model, suggesting a more complex picture. While reducing to the CV result in certain limits, our approach is more widely applicable, encompassing non-trivial impurity-crystal interactions, mobile impurities and negative growth, among others.

Observing classical nucleation theory at work by monitoring phase transitions with molecular precision	Nature Comm.	5	5598	2014	ncomms6598.pdf	It is widely accepted that many phase transitions do not follow nucleation pathways as envisaged by the classical nucleation theory. Many substances can traverse intermediate states before arriving at the stable phase. The apparent ubiquity of multi-step nucleation has made the inverse question relevant: does multistep nucleation always dominate single-step pathways? Here we provide an explicit example of the classical nucleation mechanism for a system known to exhibit the characteristics of multi-step nucleation. Molecular resolution atomic force microscopy imaging of the two-dimensional nucleation of the protein glucose isomerase demonstrates that the interior of subcritical clusters is in the same state as the crystalline bulk phase. Our data show that despite having all the characteristics typically associated with rich phase behaviour, glucose isomerase 2D crystals are formed classically. These observations illustrate the resurfacing importance of the classical nucleation theory by re-validating some of the key assumptions that have been recently questioned.

Durán-Olivencia	Classical nucleation theory from a dynamical approach to nucleation	J. of Chemical Physics	138	244908	2013	Lutsko_JCP_2013_1.pdf	It is shown that diffusion-limited classical nucleation theory (CNT) can be recovered as a simple limit of the recently proposed dynamical theory of nucleation based on fluctuating hydrodynamics (Lutsko, JCP 136, 034509 (2012)). The same framework is also used to construct a more realistic theory in which clusters have finite interfacial width. When applied to the dilute solution/dense solution transition in globular proteins, it is found that the extension gives corrections to the the nucleation rate even for the case of small supersaturations due to changes in the monomer distribution function and to the excess free energy. It is also found that the monomer attachement/detachment picture breaks down at high supersaturations corresponding to clusters smaller than about 100 molecules. The results also confirm the usual assumption that most important corrections to CNT can be acheived by means of improved estimates of the free energy barrier. The theory also illustrates two topics that have received considerable attention in the recent literature on nucleation: the importance sub-dominant corrections to the capillary model for the free energy and of the correct choice of the reaction coordinate.

Here, the direct correlation function, resulting from the Santos functional, is derived, and it is found to be very close to the result of the White Bear density functional, except near the origin where it diverges.

E	88	22108	2013	Lutsko_PRE_2013_1.pdf	We present a master equation formulation based on a Markovian random walk model that exhibits subdiffusion, classical diffusion, and superdiffusion as a function of a single parameter. The nonclassical diffusive behavior is generated by allowing for interactions between a population of walkers. At the macroscopic level, this gives rise to a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. The diffusive behavior is reflected not only in the mean squared displacement [〈r2(t)〉∼tγ with 0<γ≤1.5] but also in the existence of self-similar scaling solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation. We give a physical interpretation of sub- and superdiffusion in terms of the attractive and repulsive interactions between the diffusing particles and we discuss analytically the limiting values of the exponent γ. Simulations based on the master equation are shown to be in agreement with the analytical solutions of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation in all three diffusion regimes.

E	85	21126	2012	Boon_Lutsko__Lutsko_PRE_2012.pdf	We develop a microscopic theory for reaction-difusion (R-D) processes based on a generalization of Einstein's master equation with a reactive term and we show how the mean field formulation leads to a generalized R-D equation with non-classical solutions. For the n-th order annihilation reaction A+A+A+...+A->0, we obtain a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation for which we discuss scaling and non-scaling formulations. We find steady states with either solutions exhibiting long range power law behavior (for n>α) showing the relative dominance of sub-diffusion over reaction effects in constrained systems, or conversely solutions (for n<α<n+1) with finite support of the concentration distribution describing situations where diffusion is slow and extinction is fast. Theoretical results are compared with experimental data for morphogen gradient formation.

J. of Chemical Physics	136	134402	2012	Lutsko_JCP_2012_2.pdf	A recent description of diffusion-limited nucleation based on fluctuating hydrodynamics that extends classical nucleation theory predicts a very non-classical two-step scenario whereby nucleation is most likely to occur in spatially extended, low-amplitude density fluctuations. In this paper, it is shown how the formalism can be used to determine the maximum probability of observing any proposed nucleation pathway, thus allowing one to address the question as to their relative likelihood, including of the newly proposed pathway compared to classical scenarios. Calculations are presented for the nucleation of high-concentration droplets in a low-concentration solution of globular proteins and it is found that the relative probabilities (new theory compared to classical result) for reaching a critical nucleus containing Nc molecules scales as e−Nc/3 thus indicating that for all but the smallest nuclei, the classical scenario is extremely unlikely.

Lutsko	Nucleation of colloids and macromolecules in a finite volume	J. of Chemical Physics	137	154903	2012	Lutsko_JCP_2012_3.pdf	A recently formulated description of homogeneous nucleation for Brownian particles in the over-damped limit based on fluctuating hydrodynamics is used to determine the nucleation pathway, characterized as the most likely path (MLP), for the nucleation of a dense-concentration droplet of globular protein from a dilute solution in a small, finite container. The calculations are performed by directly discretizing the equations for the MLP and it is found that they confirm previous results obtained for infinite systems: the process of homogeneous nucleation begins with a long-wavelength, spatially-extended concentration fluctuation that it condenses to form the pre-critical cluster. This is followed by a classical growth processes. The calculations show that the post-critical growth involves the formation of a depletion zone around the cluster whereas no such depletion is observed in the pre-critical cluster. The approach therefore captures dynamical effects not found in classical Density Functional Theory studies while consistently describing the formation of the pre-critical cluster.
85	James F. Lutsko	On the role of metastable intermediate states in the homogeneous nucleation of solids from solution	Adv. Chem. Phys.	151	137	2012	Lutsko_AdvChemPhys_2011.pdf	The role of metastable liquid phases in vapor-crystal nucleation is studied using Density Functional Theory(DFT). The model gives a semi-quantitatively accurate description of both the vapor-liquid-solid phase diagram for both simple fluids (Lennard-Jones interactions) and of the low-density/high-density/crystal phase diagram for model globular proteins (ten Wolde-Frenkel interaction). The density profile is characterized by two local order parameters, the average density and the crystallinity. The bulk free energy model is supplemented by squared-derivative terms in these order parameters to account for inhomogeneities thus producing a model similar in spirit to phase-field theory. It is shown that for both interaction models, the vapor-crystal part of the phase-diagram can be separated into regions for which metastable liquid phases are more or less stable than the vapor, but always less stable than the solid. The former case allows for the possibility of double nucleation whereby liquid droplets nucleate from the vapor followed by a separate nucleation of the solid phase within the liquid droplets. Whether or not this actually occurs depends on the relative free energy barriers for vapor-solid and vapor-liquid nucleation and it is shown that for simple fluids, double nucleation is indeed favored at sufficiently large supersaturation. Finally, by studying the minimum free energy path from the vapor to the solid, the separate possibility of transient nucleation.
84	James F. Lutsko	A dynamical theory of nucleation for colloids and macromolecules	J. of Chemical Physics	136	34509	2012	Lutsko_JCP_2012_1.pdf	A general theory of nucleation for colloids and macromolecules in solution is formulated within the context of fluctuating hydrodynamics. A formalism for the determination of nucleation pathways is developed and stochastic differential equations for the evolution of order parameters are given. The conditions under which the elements of Classical Nucleation Theory are recovered are determined. The theory provides a justification and extension of more heuristic equilibrium approaches based solely on the free energy. It is illustrated by application to the low-concentration/high-concentration transition in globular proteins where a novel two-step mechanism is identified where the first step involves the formation of long-wavelength density fluctuations and the second step is the actual nucleation event occuring within the fluctuation.

Lutsko	A dynamical theory of homogeneous nucleation for colloids and macromolecules	J. of Chemical Physics	135	161101	2011	Lutsko_JCP_2011_2.pdf	Homogeneous nucleation is formulated within the context of fluctuating hydrodynamics. It is shown that for a colloidal or macromolecular system in the strong damping limit the most likely path for nucleation can be determined by gradient descent in density space governed by a nontrivial metric fixed by the dynamics. The theory provides a justification and extension of more heuristic equilibrium approaches based solely on the free energy. It is illustrated by application to liquid-vapor nucleation where it is shown that, in contrast to most free energy-based studies, the smallest clusters correspond to long wavelength, small amplitude perturbations.
82	James F. Lutsko	Density functional theory of inhomogeneous liquids. IV. Squared-gradient approximation and classical nucleation theory	J. of Chemical Physics	134	164501	2011	Lutsko_JCP_2011_1.pdf	The squared-gradient approximation to the modified-core Van der Waals density functional theory model is developed. A simple, explicit expression for the SGA coefficient involving only the bulk equation of state and the interaction potential is given. The model is solved for planar interfaces and spherical clusters and is shown to be quantitatively accurate in comparison to computer simulations. An approximate technique for solving the SGA based on piecewise-linear density profiles is introduced and is shown to give reasonable zeroth-order approximations to the numerical solution of the model. The piecewise-linear models of spherical clusters are shown to be a natural extension of classical nucleation theory and serve to clarify some of the nonclassical effects previously observed in liquid–vapor nucleation. Nucleation pathways are investigated using both constrained energy-minimization and steepest-descent techniques.

Lett.	95	20006	2011	Lutsko_2011_EPL_95_20006.pdf	We examine the non-extensive approach to the statistical mechanics of Hamiltonian systems with H = T +V, where T is the classical kinetic energy. Our analysis starts from the basics of the formalism by applying the standard variational method for maximizing the entropy subject to the average energy and normalization constraints. The analytical results show i) that the non-extensive thermodynamics formalism should be called into question to explain experimental results described by extended exponential distributions exhibiting long tails, i.e. q-exponentials with q >1, and ii) that in the thermodynamic limit the theory is only consistent in the range 0 q  1 where the distribution has finite support, thus implying that configurations with, e.g., energy above some limit have zero probability, which is at variance with the physics of systems in contact with a heat reservoir. We also discuss the (q-dependent) thermodynamic temperature and the generalized specific heat.

Lutsko	Nonextensive formalism and continuous Hamiltonian systems	Physics Letters A	375	329	2011	Lutsko_Boon_PLA_2010.pdf	A recurring question in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is what deviation from standard statistical mechanics gives rise to non-Boltzmann behavior and to nonlinear response, which amounts to identifying the emergence of “statistics from dynamics” in systems out of equilibrium. Among several possible analytical developments which have been proposed, the idea of nonextensive statistics introduced by Tsallis about 20 years ago was to develop a statistical mechanical theory for systems out of equilibrium where the Boltzmann distribution no longer holds, and to generalize the Boltzmann entropy by a more general function Sq while maintaining the formalism of thermodynamics. From a phenomenological viewpoint, nonextensive statistics appeared to be of interest because maximization of the generalized entropy Sq yields the q-exponential distribution which has been successfully used to describe distributions observed in a large class of phenomena, in particular power law distributions for q > 1. Here we re-examine the validity of the nonextensive formalism for continuous Hamiltonian systems. In particular we consider the q-ideal gas, a model system of quasi-particles where the effect of the interactions are included in the particle properties. On the basis of exact results for the q-ideal gas, we find that the theory is restricted to the range q < 1, which raises the question

Matt.	22	65101	2010	Lutsko_Laidet_Grosfils_JCondMatt_2009.pdf	The equilibrium density distribution and thermodynamic properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid confined to nanosized spherical cavities at a constant chemical potential was determined using Monte Carlo simulations. The results describe both a single cavity with semi-permeable walls as well as a collection of closed cavities formed at the constant chemical potential. The results are compared to calculations using classical density functional theory (DFT). It is found that the DFT calculations give a quantitatively accurate description of the pressure and structure of the fluid. Both theory and simulation show the presence of a 'reverse' liquid–vapor transition whereby the equilibrium state is a liquid at large volumes but becomes a vapor at small volumes.

Lutsko	Low-Density/High-Density Liquid Phase Transition for Model Globular Proteins	Langmuir	26	8510	2010	Lutsko_2010_Langmuir.pdf	The effect of molecule size (excluded volume) and the range of interaction on the surface tension, phase diagram, and nucleation properties of a model globular protein is investigated using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and finite temperature classical density functional theory calculations. We use a parametrized potential that can vary smoothly from the standard Lennard-Jones interaction characteristic of simple fluids to the ten Wolde-Frenkel model for the effective interaction of globular proteins in solution. We find that the large excluded volume characteristic of large macromolecules such as proteins is the dominant effect in determining the liquid-vapor surface tension and nucleation properties. The variation of the range of the potential is important only in the case of small excluded volumes such as for simple fluids. The DFT calculations are then used to study the homogeneous nucleation of the high-density phase from the low-density phase including the nucleation barriers, nucleation pathways, and rate. It is found that the nucleation barriers are typically only a few kBT and that the nucleation rates are substantially higher than would be predicted by classical nucleation theory.

At low supersaturation, the surface of the crystal is smooth and increasing in size due to the nucleation of steps at defects and the subsequent growth of the steps. At high supersaturation, nucleation occurs at many places simultaneously, the crystal surface becomes rough, and the growth velocity increases more rapidly with increasing supersaturation than in the smooth regime. Kinetic roughening transitions are typically assumed to be due to the vanishing of the barrier for two-dimension nucleation on the surface of the crystal. We show here, by means of both analytic mean-field models and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, that a transition between different growth modes reminiscent of kinetic roughening can also arise as a kinetic effect occurring at finite nucleation barriers.

The model accounts for a long induction period in the process. The proposed mechanism also gives insight on future experiments aiming at a more comprehensive picture of the role of self-organization in self-assembly processes.

The interaction range is varied from rc* = 2.5 to rc* = 6 and the surface tension is determined for temperatures ranging from T* = 0.7 up to the critical temperature in each case. The results are shown to be consistent with previous studies. The simulation data are well-described by Guggenheim's law of corresponding states but the agreement of the theoretical results depends on the quality of the bulk equation of state.

Lett.	86	40005	2009	Lutsko_EPL_2009_1.pdf	The question of whether the Tsallis entropy is Lesche-stable is revisited. It is argued that when physical averages are computed with the escort probabilities, the correct application of the concept of Lesche-stability requires use of the escort probabilities. As a consequence, as shown here, the Tsallis entropy is unstable but the thermodynamic averages are stable. We further show that Lesche stability as well as thermodynamic stability can be obtained if the homogeneous entropy is used as the basis of the formulation of non-extensive thermodynamics. In this approach, the escort distribution arises naturally as a secondary structure.

In Irving and Kirkwood’s approach both interatomic forces and atomic velocities contribute to stress. It is the velocity-dependent part that has been disputed. To help clarify this situation we investigate (i) a fluid in a gravitational field and (ii) a steadily rotating solid. For both problems we choose conditions where the two stress contributions, potential and kinetic, are significant. The analytic force-balance solutions of both these problems agree very well with a smooth-particle interpretation of the atomistic Irving-Kirkwood stress tensor.

The result is a generalized form of the classical Fokker-Planck equation where the effects of drift, due to a violation of detailed balance, and of external fields are also considered. It is shown that in the absence of drift and external fields a scaling solution, describing anomalous diffusion, is possible only if the nonlinearity in the jump probability is of the power law type [ f(r,t)], in which case the generalized Fokker-Planck equation reduces to the porous media equation. Monte Carlo simulations are shown to confirm the theoretical results.

Liquid-vapor nucleation	J. of Chemical Physics	129	244501	2008	Lutsko_JCP_2008_3.pdf	The process of nucleation of vapor bubbles from a superheated liquid and of liquid droplets from a supersaturated vapor is investigated using the Modified-Core van der Waals model Density Functional Theory (Lutsko, JCP 128, 184711 (2008)). A novel approach is developed whereby nucleation is viewed as a transition from a metastable state to a stable state via the minimum free energy path which is identified using the nudged elastic-band method for exploring free energy surfaces. This allows for the unbiased calculation of the properties of sub- and super-critical clusters, as well as of the critical cluster. For Lennard-Jones fluids, the results compare well to simulation and support the view that even at high supersaturation nucleation proceeds smoothly rather than via spinodal-like instabilities as has been suggested recently.

A fundamental measure approach	J. of Chemical Physics	128	184711	2008	Lutsko_JCP_2008_1.pdf	Previously, it has been shown that the direct correlation function for a Lennard–Jones fluid could be modeled by a sum of that for hard-spheres, a mean-field tail, and a simple linear correction in the core region constructed so as to reproduce the (known) bulk equation of state of the fluid [Lutsko, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 054701 (2007)]. Here, this model is combined with ideas from the fundamental measure theory to construct a density functional theory for the free energy. The theory is shown to accurately describe a range of inhomogeneous conditions including the liquid vapor interface, the fluid in contact with a hard wall, and a fluid confined in a slit pore. The theory gives quantitatively accurate predictions for the surface tension, including its dependence on the potential cutoff. It also obeys two important exact conditions: That relating the direct correlation function to the functional derivative of the free energy with respect to density and the wall theorem.
67	James F. Lutsko	Theoretical description of the nucleation of vapor bubbles in a superheated fluid	EuroPhys. Lett.	83	46007	2008	Lutsko_EPL_2008_1.pdf	The nucleation of vapor bubbles within a superheated fluid is studied using density functional theory. The nudged elastic band technique is used to find the minimum energy pathway from the metastable uniform liquid to the stable uniform gas thus emphasizing the analogy between the the nucleation problem and that of chemical reactions. The result is both an accurate determination of the critical nucleus and an unbiased description of the density profile at various points along the path between the free energy extrema. This calculation is compared to two other methods: the use of parametrized profiles and constrained minimization of the free energy. The results indicate that the recent claim, based on the constraint method, that bubble nucleation and growth involves an activated instability is incorrect.

The liquid-vapor interface in Lennard-Jones fluids	J. of Chemical Physics	127	54701	2007	Lutsko_JCP_2007.pdf	A simple model is proposed for the direct correlation function (DCF) for simple fluids consisting of a hard-core contribution, a simple parametrized core correction, and a mean-field tail. The model requires as input only the free energy of the homogeneous fluid, obtained, e.g., from thermodynamic perturbation theory. Comparison to the DCF obtained from simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid shows this to be a surprisingly good approximation for a wide range of densities. The model is used to construct a density functional theory for inhomogeneous fluids which is applied to the problem of calculating the surface tension of the liquid-vapor interface. The numerical values found are in good agreement with simulation.
65	Jean Pierre Boon and James F. Lutsko	From Einstein to generalized diffusion	AIP Conference Proceedings	965	157	2007	Boon_Lutsko_AIP_2007.pdf	We show that from a generalization of Einstein's master equation for the random walk one obtains a generalized equation for diffusion processes. The master equation is generalized by making the particle jump probability Pj(r) a functional of the particle distribution function f(r,t). If one demands that the resulting generalized diffusion equation admits of scaling solutions: f(r;t) = t−gamma/2phi(r/tgamma/2), a power law Pj(r)[proportional]f(r)alpha−1 (with alpha>1) follows, and the solutions exhibit q-exponential forms which are found to be in agreement with the results of Monte-Carlo simulations, providing a microscopic basis validating the nonlinear diffusion equation. We also show that the phenomenological porous media equation is an approximation to the generalized advection-diffusion equation.

Lett.	80	60006	2007	Boon_Lutsko_EPL_2007.pdf	We generalize Einstein's master equation for random-walk processes by considering that the probability for a particle at position r to make a jump of length j lattice sites, Pj(r), is a functional of the particle distribution function f(r, t). By multiscale expansion, we obtain a generalized advection-diffusion equation. We show that the power law Pj(r)[?]f(r)a-1 (with a>1) follows from the requirement that the generalized equation admits scaling solutions (f(r;t)=t[?]gph(r/tg)). The solutions have a q-exponential form and are found to be in agreement with the results of Monte Carlo simulations, so providing a microscopic basis validating the nonlinear diffusion equation. Although its hydrodynamic limit is equivalent to the phenomenological porous media equation, there are extra terms which, in general, cannot be neglected as evidenced by the Monte Carlo computations.

This paper presents an extension of the method so as to allow for expansions about arbitrary, far-from-equilibrium reference states. The primary result is a set of hydrodynamic equations for studying variations from the arbitrary reference state which, unlike the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, does not restrict the reference state in any way. The method is illustrated by application to a sheared granular gas which cannot be studied using the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics.

We find that, both for a model globular protein and for a simple atomic fluid modeled with a Lennard-Jones interaction, it is free-energetically easier to crystallize by passing through a metastable dense fluid in accord with the Ostwald rule of stages but in contrast to the alternative of ordering and densifying at once as assumed in the classical picture of crystallization.

These nonlinear equations are usually constructed on a phenomenological basis. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation by defining the q-generating function which, when applied to the intermediate scattering function of classical statistical mechanics, yields, in a mathematically systematic derivation, a generalized form of the advection–diffusion equation in Fourier space. Its solutions are discussed and suggest that the q-generating function approach should be a useful method to generalize classical diffusive transport formulations.

The goal here is to extend and complete an earlier derivation by Löwen et al. [Europhys. Lett. 9 (1989) 791]. The limitations of the resulting expressions are also discussed including the boundary conditions needed for finite systems and the fact that the results cannot, at present, be used to take into account elastic relaxation.

The homogeneous cooling state of a uniform system and the modified Navier-Stokes equations are discussed and explicit expressions given for the pressure, cooling rates, and all transport coefficients for D dimensions. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically for the case of a two-dimensional gas subject to a circular piston so as to illustrate the effects of the enegy loss on the structure of shocks found in cavitating bubbles. It is found that the maximal temperature achieved is a sensitive function of Delta with a minimum occurring near the physically important value of Delta 12 000 K 1 eV.
58	James F. Lutsko	Properties of non-fcc hard-sphere solids predicted by density functional theory	Phys. Rev.

[Phys. Rev. E 55, 4245 (1997)], Tarazona [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 694 (2001)], and Roth et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 14, 12063 (2002)] in the Gaussian approximation. For the fcc phase, the present work confirms the vanishing of the Lindemann parameter (i.e., vanishing of the width of the Gaussians) near close packing for all three models and the results for the hcp phase are nearly identical. For the bcc phase and for packing fractions above eta 0.56, all three theories show multiple solid structures differing in the widths of the Gaussians. In all three cases, one of these structures shows the expected vanishing of the Lindemann parameter at close packing, but this physical structure is only thermodynamically favored over the unphysical structures in the Tarazona theory and even then, some unphysical behavior persists at lower densities. The simple cubic phase is stabilized in the model of Rosenfeld et al. for a range of densities and in the Tarazona model only very near close packing.

A generalization of the Grad moment method, implemented by means of a novel generating function technique, is used so as to avoid any assumptions concerning the size of the shear rate. The result is illustrated by using it to calculate the pressure, normal stresses, and shear viscosity of a model polydisperse granular fluid in which grain size, mass, and coefficient of restitution vary among the grains. The results are compared to a numerical solution of the Enskog equation as well as molecular-dynamics simulations. Most bulk properties are well described by the Enskog theory and it is shown that the generalized moment method is more accurate than the simple (Grad) moment method. However, the description of the distribution of temperatures in the mixture predicted by Enskog theory does not compare well to simulation, even at relatively modest densities.

R. ten Wolde and D. Frenkel Science 77, 1975 (1997)] using computer simulation. It is found that the reported phase diagrams are accurately reproduced.

B	71	184108	2005	Lutsko_PRB_2005_1.pdf	The elastic moduli of a solid can be determined from the thermal fluctuations of the stress. The so-called stress-fluctuation approach is useful in that it can provide insights into the molecular origin of a particular mechanical response, and it leads to faster convergence than methods based on fluctuations of the strain. Unfortunately the implementation of the stress-fluctuation approach is more demanding than that of the strain- fluctuation approach, particularly for atomistic models involving intramolecular interactions se.g., bending and torsiond. In this study a simple numerical method is proposed to evaluate the elastic moduli of atomistic models from knowledge of atomistic forces. It is shown that this approach leads to fast and reliable prediction of the elastic moduli for two different classes of materials. In one example the elastic moduli of crystalline silicon are compared to those reported in the literature. In the other example the elastic moduli of an atomistic polymer model for polysmethyl methacrylatedare shown to be in good agreement with experimental data.

Here, we show that a very similar equation can be derived, in a systematic manner, for a classical fluid by assuming nonlinear response, i.e. that the diffusive flux depends on gradients of a power of the concentration. The present equation distinguishes from the porous-media equation in that it describes generalized classical diffusion, i.e. with r/sqrt(Dt scaling, but with a generalized Einstein relation, and with power-law probability distributions typical of non-extensive statistical mechanics.)

The exact balance equations for concentration, density, velocity, and temperature are derived. The Enskog approximation is discussed and used as the basis for the derivation, via the Chapman–Enskog procedure, of the Navier–Stokes reaction equations under various assumptions about the speed of the chemical reactions. It is shown that the phenomenological description consisting of a reaction–diffusion equation with a convective coupling to the Navier–Stokes equations is of limited applicability.

Under supersonic contraction speed, a shock wave converges to the center of the cavity where it implodes, creating a central peak in temperature. The dynamics of the fluid is studied by solving the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, as well as by molecular dynamics simulations and the Enskog direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The value of the maximum temperature reached at the center of the cavity is systematically investigated with the different methods which give consistent results. Moreover, we develop a scaling theory for the maximum temperature based on the self-similar solutions of Euler's equations and mean-free-path considerations. This scaling theory provides a comprehensive scheme for the interpretation of the numerical results. In addition, the effects of the imploding shock wave on an passively driven isomerization reaction A[r harp over l]B are also studied.

The equation is obtained as the hydrodynamic limit of the first visit equation, an exact microscopic finite difference equation describing the motion of a particle on a lattice whose sites operate as time-delayers. The propagation-dispersion equation should be contrasted with the advection-diffusion equation (or the classical Fokker–Planck equation) as it describes a dispersion process in time (instead of diffusion in space) with a drift expressed by a propagation speed with non-zero bounded values. The temporal dispersion coefficient is shown to exhibit a form analogous to Taylor's dispersivity. Physical systems where the propagation-dispersion equation applies are discussed.

The formally exact Einstein and Green-Kubo expressions for the self-diffusion coefficient are evaluated there from an approximation to the velocity autocorrelation function. These results are compared here to those from molecular-dynamics simulations over a wide range of density and inelasticity, for the particular case of self-diffusion. It is found that the approximate theory is in good agreement with simulation data up to moderate densities and degrees of inelasticity. At higher density, the effects of inelasticity are stronger, leading to a significant enhancement of the diffusion coefficient over its value for elastic collisions. Possible explanations associated with an unstable long wavelength shear mode are explored, including the effects of strong fluctuations and mode coupling.

E	65	51303	2002	Lutsko_PRE_2002_1.pdf	Many important properties of granular fluids can be represented by a system of hard spheres with inelastic collisions. Traditional methods of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics are effective for analysis and description of the inelastic case as well. This is illustrated here for diffusion of an impurity particle in a fluid undergoing homogeneous cooling. An appropriate scaling of the Liouville equation is described such that the homogeneous cooling ensemble and associated time correlation functions map to those of a stationary state. In this form the familiar methods of linear response can be applied, leading to Green-Kubo and Einstein representations of diffusion in terms of the velocity and mean-square displacement correlation functions. These correlation functions are evaluated approximately using a cumulant expansion and from kinetic theory, providing the diffusion coefficient as a function of the density and the restitution coefficients. Comparisons with results from molecular-dynamics simulation are given in the following companion paper.

An exact relation between the density autocorrelation function and the density-mometum correlation function implies that the former must decay more rapidly than 1/r, in contrast to predictions of simple mode-coupling theory. Analytic and numerical evaluation of a nonperturbative mode-coupling model confirms a crossover from 1/r behavior at ”small” r to a stronger asymptotic power-law decay. The characteristic length scale is [script l][approximate]sqrt( lambda[sub 0]/a), where lambda0 is the sound damping constant and a is the shear rate.

The PDF at contact is calculated within the Enskog approximation and is shown to be in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations for shear rates below the shear-induced ordering transition. These calculations are used to construct a nonequilibrium generalized mean-spherical approximation for the PDF at finite separations, which is also found to agree well with the simulation data.

Lett.	86	3344	2001	Lutsko2001.pdf	A model for the pair-distribution function of nonequilibrium hard-core fluids is proposed based on a model for the effect of velocity correlations on the structure. Good agreement is found with molecular dynamics simulations of granular fluids and of sheared elastic hard spheres. It is argued that the incorporation of velocity correlations are crucial to correctly modeling atomic scale structure in nonequilibrium fluids.

40	A. Suarez and J.F. Lutsko	Globally optimal fuzzy decision trees for classification and regression	IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence	21	1280	1999	SuarezLutsko.pdf	A fuzzy decision tree is constructed by allowing the possibility of partial membership of a point in the nodes that make up the tree structure. This extension of its expressive capabilities transforms the decision tree into a powerful functional approximant that incorporates features of connectionist methods, while remaining easily interpretable. Fuzzification is achieved by superimposing a fuzzy structure over the skeleton of a CART decision tree. A training rule for fuzzy trees, similar to backpropagation in neural networks, is designed. This rule corresponds to a global optimization algorithm that fixes the parameters of the fuzzy splits. The method developed for the automatic generation of fuzzy decision trees is applied to both classification and regression problems. In regression problems, it is seen that the continuity constraint imposed by the function representation of the fuzzy tree leads to substantial improvements in the quality of the regression and limits the tendency to overfitting. In classification, fuzzification provides a means of uncovering the structure of the probability distribution for the classification errors in attribute space. This allows the identification of regions for which the error rate of the tree is significantly lower than the average error rate, sometimes even below the Bayes misclassification rate.
39	James F. Lutsko	Viscoelastic effects from the Enskog equation for uniform shear flow	Phys. Rev. E	58	434	1998	LutskoEnskog.pdf	The Enskog kinetic equation for hard spheres is the only tractable theory with which the transport properties of a moderately dense gas can be studied. However, relatively little is known about its solutions outside the linear regime. In this paper two approximate nonlinear solutions of the Enskog equation for uniform shear flow are presented: a perturbative solution to second order in the shear rate and to fourth order in velocity moments and a ”nonperturbative” moment solution to all orders in the shear rate and to second order in the velocity moments. A comparison to the results of nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations shows that the perturbative results give good estimates of the quadratic corrections to the pressure tensor while the nonperturbative solution gives a semiquantitative description of viscoelastic effects including shear thinning and the normal stresses over a wide range of shear rates. The relevance of these results to the construction of kinetic models of the Enskog equation is also discussed.

E	57	546	1998	Lutsko_1998_1.pdf	The stability of idealized computer shear flow at long wavelengths is studied in detail. A hydrodynamic analysis at the level of the Navier-Stokes equation for small shear rates is given to identify the origin and universality of an instability at any finite shear rate for sufficiently long wavelength perturbations. The analysis is extended to larger shear rates using a low density model kinetic equation. Direct Monte Carlo simulation of this equation is compared with a hydrodynamic description including non-Newtonian rheological effects. The hydrodynamic description of the instability is in good agreement with the direct Monte Carlo simulation for t<50t0, where t0 is the mean free time. Longer time simulations up to 2000t0 are used to identify the asymptotic state as a spatially nonuniform quasistationary state. Finally, preliminary results from molecular dynamics simulation showing the instability are presented and discussed.

Comparison to nonequilibrium molecular dynamics demonstrates that the lowest order solution gives a good quantitative description of nonlinear effects such as shear thinning and normal stresses in a moderately dense fluid. The results are used as a basis in the formulation of a simple and quantitatively accurate kinetic model of the Enskog equation.

This precursor to the ordering is explained on the basis of a careful interpretation of the meaning of ”molecular chaos” in hard-sphere systems. An ansatz is proposed to model the nonequilibrium PDF at finite separations and is shown to compare well with simulations.

It is shown that the hydrodynamic equations for this state have a long wavelength instability. This result is obtained first from the Navier-Stokes equations and shown to apply at both low and high densities. Next, higher order rheological effects are included using a model kinetic theory. The results are compared favorably to those from Monte Carlo simulation.

Very good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations of Meijer and Frenkel [J. Chem. Phys. 94, 2269 (1991)] is found for both the fluid and the (fcc-bcc) solid phases. The location of the two-phase coexistences, however, is shown to involve such small free-energy and density changes that no definite statements about the phase diagram are possible within the present accuracy.

Fluid Mech	238	467	1992		"Various difficulties can be expected in trying to extract from experimental data the distribution of singularities, the f(α) function, of the energy dissipation. One reason is that the multifractal model of turbulence implies a dependence of the viscous cutoff on the singularity exponent. It is an open question if current hot-wire probes can resolve the scales implied by exponents a significantly less than 1.
Two exactly soluble models are used to show how spurious scaling can occur, due to finite Reynolds number effects. In the Gaussian model the true velocity signal is replaced by independent Gaussian random variables. The dissipation, defined as the square of the difference of successive variables, has trivial scaling in so far as all the moments of spatial averages of the dissipation behave asymptotically as a uniform dissipation. Still, contamination by subdominant terms requires that scaling exponents for high-order moments be identified over an increasingly large range of scales. If the available range is limited by the Reynolds number, scaling exponents for high orders will be systematically underestimated and spurious intermittency will be inferred. Burgers’ model is used to highlight further problems. At finite Reynolds numbers, regions with no small-scale activity (away from shocks) have a residual dissipation which contributes a spurious point (α = 1,f(α) = 1). In addition, when the f(α) function is obtained by Legendre transform techniques, convex hull effects generate an entire spurious segment.
 Finally, Burgers’ model also indicates that the relation between exponents of structure functions and exponents of local dissipation moments, which goes back to Kolmogorov's (1962) work, leads to an inconsistency for structure functions of low positive order."

This reformulation is used as a basis for discussion as to why some theories work better than others when applied to hard spheres, why most theories perform poorly for continuous potentials, and in what direction they might be modified so as to improve their performance

In particular, the authors find that for 1<or=n<or=6 there is both a fluid-BCC and BCC-FCC transition whereas for n>6 the BCC phase is unstable and only the fluid-FCC transition survives, in agreement with the computer simulations.

Results of simulations on a high‐angle (001) twist grain boundary are illustrated, using both a Lennard–Jones potential for Cuand an embedded‐atom potential for Au. The two conceptionally rather different potentials show similar anomalies in all elastic constants, confined to within a few lattice planes of the grain boundary, with an especially dramatic reduction in the resistance to shear parallel to the grain‐boundary plane. It is found that the primary cause of the anomalies is the atomic disorder near the grain boundary, as evidenced by the slice‐by‐slice radial distribution functions for the inhomogeneous interface system.

Through molecular dynamics simulations we demonstrate that every crystal, in principle, can undergo two different types of melting transitions with characteristic features that are also observed in radiation- and hydrogenation-induced amorphization experiments on ordered alloys. The first type, defined in terms of free energies, is shown to involve the heterogeneous nucleation of the liquid or amorphous phase at extended lattice defects (such as grain boundaries, free surfaces, voids, or dislocations) and subsequent thermally-activated propagation of solid-liquid/amorphous interfaces through the crystal. The second type, arising from a mechanical instability limit described by Born, is homogeneous and does not require thermally-activated atom mobility. It is suggested that the role of chemical and structural disordering, a prerequisite for irradiation- but not hydrogenation-induced solid-state amorphization, is merely to drive the crystal lattice to a critical combination of volume and temperature at which the amorphous phase can form either heterogeneously or homogeneously.

A	39	1311	1989	Lutsko_Shear_Fluctuations.pdf	A set of nonlinear Langevin equations for fluctuations of the local conserved densities in a fluid under shear is proposed. These equations are a model for the extension of hydrodynamics to very short wavelengths at liquid densities. The hydrodynamic modes associated with the linearized equations are studied as a function of wave vector and shear rate. The degeneracy of the viscous shear modes is lifted by the shear, and one of these modes combines with the heat mode to form a propagating pair. As an example of nonequilibrium fluctuations, the dynamic structure factor is calculated for several values of frequency and wave vector. At large shear rates one pair of propagating modes becomes unstable at a wavelength of the order of the particle size. This instability is suggested as a possible explanation for a shear-induced disorder-order transition seen in computer simulations. Nonlinear mode-coupling effects are studied elsewhere.

The method uses the basic Parrinello-Rahman (constant-stress) scheme, modified for the application to inhomogeneous systems. Since our computational cell contains only one interface with two-dimensional (2D) periodic border conditions, we are able to study isolated interfaces all the way up to melting. The interaction between boundaries which may lead to their annihilation at higher temperatures, which is a problem when 3D periodic borders are applied, is thus avoided. As an application, the method is used to study the stability of a grain boundary at high temperatures. Observations on a possible connection between grain-boundary migration and “premelting” are discussed.
